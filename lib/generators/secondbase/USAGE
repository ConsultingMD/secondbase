Description:
    Stubs out a new (second)database migration. Pass the migration name, either
    CamelCased or under_scored, and an optional list of attribute pairs as arguments.

    For your organizational convenience, a migration class is generated in 
    db/migrate/secondbase prefixed by a timestamp of the current date and time.

    You can name your migration in either of these formats to generate add/remove
    column lines from supplied attributes: AddColumnsToTable or RemoveColumnsFromTable

Example:
    `rails generate secondbase_migration AddSslFlag`

    If the current date is May 14, 2008 and the current time 09:09:12, this creates the AddSslFlag migration
    db/migrate/secondbase/20080514090912_add_ssl_flag.rb

    `rails generate secondbase_migration AddTitleBodyToPost title:string body:text published:boolean`
    
    This will create the AddTitleBodyToPost in db/migrate/secondbase/20080514090912_add_title_body_to_post.rb with
    this in the Up migration:

      add_column :posts, :title, :string  
      add_column :posts, :body, :text  
      add_column :posts, :published, :boolean

    And this in the Down migration:
    
      remove_column :posts, :published  
      remove_column :posts, :body  
      remove_column :posts, :title

    You can continue to use `rake db:migrate` to migrate your first and second databases, or you can 
    target secondbase by using `rake db:migrate:secondbase`.  Remember, your migrations are timestamped, 
    so regardless of the database they target, they will be unique and you will not have collision issues.
